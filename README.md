# Anderson-model-on-graphs

Script for creating graphs (random regular graph, Erdos-Reyni graph, small world network and uniformly distributed random graph), applying Anderson model on the graph, using exact diagonalization to extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors and finally calculating ergodicity indicators (averaged level separation ratio, fractal dimensionality and entangelment entropy). I the following libraries: networkx for graph creation, numpy for calcuation, qutip for calculating partial trace and entangelment entropy and some other standard python libraries.
